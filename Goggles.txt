Goggles the Goblin did not have a very happy day.
In fact it was quiet the opposite of okay.
All day we was being chased by bugs he hated bugs.
The bugs weren't very nice all they wanted to do was sting him.
To be fair Goggles was wandering around the flower field where they normall dwell.
Finally Goggles got back to his house and thankfully none of the mean bugs entered the house with him.
